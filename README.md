## Drively API
    Current version: 1
API documentation for Drively.

### Updates
[Version 1 documentation](/DrivelyApp/API/master/1/) now available as a work-in-progress.

### Who is this for?
* Developers of other applications who want to utilize our data (see OAuth below)
* Developers of our own iOS and Android apps (see source code)
* DoorDash (stay out of our swamp, Tony)

### OAuth
To get started with our API, you need to go to [your Apps settings](https://drively.ml/settings/apps) on drivelyapp.com (*temporarily* drively.ml) to get an application ID. That will allow you to use all of our public, anonymous data. Using that ID, users may authorize your app to receive personal data and complete actions like posting messages, editing their profile, and much more. You can learn more about OAuth with [this simplified Medium article](https://aaronparecki.com/oauth-2-simplified/).

    Note: if you're an internal developer working on our native mobile apps, please contact RyanG for an access token with full permissions.
